<p>The best parts of React meets Ionic</p>

Ionic and React take the flexibility of `react-dom` and adds the components that you know and love from Ionic. If you're just getting started, take a look at a few guides below.

## Installation

<command-line>
    <command-prompt>npm install -g ionic@latest</command-prompt>
    <command-prompt>ionic start myApp tabs --type react</command-prompt>
    <br/>
    <command-prompt>ionic serve <command-cursor blink></command-cursor></command-prompt>
</command-line>

## Standard React tools

Ionic React projects are just like React projects, leveraging [react-dom](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html) and with setup normally found in a [Create React App (CRA)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) app. For [routing and navigation](/docs/react/navigation), React Router is used under the hood.

## Native Tools

Ionic React officially supports [Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com) as it's native runtime. This means it's possible to deploy to native iOS, native Android, Electron, and the web with PWAs.

## Just React

At the end of the day, it's just React. Choose any of the millions of libraries that exist that work in the browser. Taking the ideas of "learn one, write anywhere" and "write once, run anywhere" to it's full potential.
